This was a solo project created in Android Studio that replicated a contacts application on an smartphone. This application is running on an Android device.

# Add Contact
Here is the screen for adding a new contact. When the information is filled out, the user can click the 'OK' button to add the new contact.

The user can edit and delete the contact. They can even locate the contact, which will open Google Maps and insert the saved location in the search bar.
